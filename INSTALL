EPUB building makefile installation instructions
================================================

The EPUB building makefile is just a single makefile - it does not require any
installation.

To use it with a new ebook project, simply copy the makefile (named `Makefile`)
into the project. There is no need to edit the makefile - it is ready to use
with any new ebook project as is. All that is required is the creation if a file
named `book.mk` in the same directory as the makefile. The variables that must
be set in `book.mk` are described in the file README, and there is a sample
`book.mk` provided in this package.
