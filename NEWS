Version 1.0.1 ----------------------------------------------------- [2016-01-31]

*   [BUGFIX] The "store" zip command was used for all files, not just
    `mimetype`. This has been fixed; all files other than `mimetype`
    now use the "add" command.
    
*   [BUGFIX] The "store" zip command didn't actually store (though it
    just happened to work for `mimetype` because `mimetype` was too
    small to compress regardless). Now the "store" command actually
    stores.
    
*   [PERFORMANCE] The "no extra fields" flag was added to the zip "add"
    command. This shaves a few bytes off each entry in the zip; I got
    about a ~1% decrease in the final ebook size. (In practice, you
    shouldn't notice any improvement over 1.0.0, because due to bugs
    1.0.0 wasn't using the zip "add" command anyway - it was using the
    zip "store" command for all files, which never added the extra
    fields.)


Version 1.0.0 ----------------------------------------------------- [2016-01-30]

*   EPUB building makefile first release.
